# Ip Camera
The current version of Docker Desktop for macOS does not support USB/camera pass through and VMWare Fusion (at least by default or with the facetime camera) and a number of other hypervisors have very poor performance.  This approach provides a simple approach to "stream" the host's camera to the container/VM over the network.  

Note, Parallels camera support is very good and does not need this work around.
